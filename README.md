Pre-release material CIE IGCSE Computer science 2016
This is my first project on GitHub. It's a question from a pre-released material of the CIE IGCSE computer science course. I teach this course for my grade 10 students in Yantai, China.

For this specific question, I tried to use list only. I believe dictionary is beyond the syllabus requirement.
First I created 3 for's to populate the list. Then, I showed my students that it was a repetitive task. After a bit of teaching, we moved everything to functions to make the code more concise.

I haven't finish it yet (23/11/2018) because I don't want to give it easily to students. They have to work for it.

Right now I am testing the functions and loops. Afterwards It will be easy to finish the coding, including comments.

Any comments will be appreciated but please, look at the syllabus first. List and functions are the limit.
